Questions: 

1. When we malloc(), the object is removed from the free list but where does it go? We return a RAW. next -> raw

decrement: superblock count, total free objects in superblock pool 
- how do we/ do we need to keep track of its location

2. When we free(), how do we keep track of the pointer to the position where it was before the object was malloc()ed. 

3. is mmap correct? bookkeeping?

4. explain how superblocks work.
